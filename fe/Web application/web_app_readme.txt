This is the standalone version of the application that started its development in
the /apps/SatTracker folder. The worldwindlib.js file is a modified version of the
regular Web WorldWind library. Official Web WorldWind wasn't made for displaying
objects in space, so some modifications were done to it to better suit the needs
of SpaceBirds.
